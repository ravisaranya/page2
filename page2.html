                        Sushant Singh Rajput's debut Bollywood film, Kai Po Che completes 8 years today. The movie, an adaptation of Chetan Bhagat's The 3 Mistakes of My Life, also starred Amit Sadh and Rajkummar Rao, and was directed by Abhishek Kapoor
                        Late actor Sushant Singh Rajput lived with his character Ishaan for four months before getting on the sets to shoot Kai Po Che. As his debut Bollywood film completes 8 years on Monday, we look back at the making of the Abhishek Kapoor directorial that released on this day in 2013.
                        In the behind-the-scenes video, Sushant shared how he got immersed in playing the role of Ishaan, a failed cricketer in the movie. “I’ve been thinking about Ishaan 90 percent of the time, for the past four months. Nowadays, it seems that I’ve started living and thinking like him. It is not that it happened because of this reason or that reason. It just happened,” Sushant shared in the video.

                    <p class="data main">
                        He further explained his character as, “My character of Ishaan is a cricketer, impulsive, transparent, and not a hypocrite. So you’ll find very less people like him who are clean at heart. He’s a very interesting character and I loved playing him.”
                        Sushant, who died on June 14, 2020, entered Bollywood with Kai Po Che, after playing the fan favourite role of Manav in hit TV show Pavitra Rishta.
                        Sushant went on to do movies like Shuddh Desi Romance, PK, Detective Byomkesh Bakshy, Raabta, M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story, Kedarnath, Chhichhore and Sonchiriya. His last onscreen appearance was in Dil Bechara which released post his demise on Disney+ Hotstar last year.
                        Also starring then newbies Amit Sadh and Rajkummar Rao, Kai Po Che is adapted from Chetan Bhagat’s bestselling novel The 3 Mistakes of My Life.

                     Demonising freedom to love in New India will contribute to growing suicide toll of young people imposing harsh penalties on ‘forced conversions’ under the pretext of marriage

                </p>

                <P class="data main">The recent passage of the so-called ‘love jihad’ laws in three states of the country, imposing harsh penalties on ‘forced conversions’ under the pretext of marriage, represents a new and daunting challenge to love in India.
                    Last March, 29-year-old G Ramadoss and 20-year-old U Nandhini jumped onto the path of an oncoming train in Vellore. They belonged to different castes and their parents had refused to accept their love.
                    In May, 24-year-old Rahul and his 22-year-old wife Rani, committed suicide in Bengaluru because their parents refused to accept their love. Rahul was a Hindu and Rani was a Muslim
                    These four young Indians join a long and growing list of lovers who preferred to die than bow to the structural oppression and violence which have kept us divided for millennia

                    While most people cannot afford to buy flagship smartphones, mobile phone companies and chip makers have focused more on mid-range phones to provide a better gaming experience. If you are looking to buy a gaming smartphone below Rs 25,000, here are a few options you should consider.
